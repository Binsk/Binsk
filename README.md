## Howdy-Do!

Welcome to my Github profile! I am currently in the process of moving some of my repos out of Github and into [Codeberg]([https://codeberg.org/](https://codeberg.org/Binsk)), a [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)-based git hosting instance.

I'm not disappearing from Github altogether but any of my new projects will likely be on there instead of here and you may find a couple archived repos that point to a Codeberg repo in their README.

To anyone following one of these repos, sorry for the trouble!
